        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a good doughnut on a Saturday morning. This simple cake doughnut can be enhanced by any number of icing and toppings.<br>
        To list a few of my families favorites: Mapel bacon, Stawberry, Peanut Butter Chocolate.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tspfreshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 TBS unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Vegetable shortening, for frying</li>
                   </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>  
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a 3-inch-round cookie cutter or glass to trace 12 circles on the parchment, <br>
                leaving space between each. Flip the parchment over and lightly coat with cooking spray. Fit a pastry bag with a <br> 
                1/2-inch round tip or snip a 1/2-inch hole in one corner of a large resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour, baking powder, nutmeg and salt into a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer<br>
                 on medium speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Beat in the whole egg and yolk until incorporated and the mixture<br>
                  turns pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Beat in the milk and vanilla until smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed. Reduce<br>
                   the mixer speed to low; gradually beat in the flour mixture until just incorporated (do not overmix). Transfer the batter<br>
                    to the prepared pastry bag.</li>
            <li>Using the circles as a guide, pipe the batter into 3-inch rings. (To make doughnut holes with the remaining batter, pipe<br>
                 1-inch rounds onto the parchment.) Refrigerate while you heat the shortening, or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat about 6 cups shortening in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 340 degrees F. (You want <br>
                to have about 2 inches of liquid once the shortening melts.) Use scissors to cut the parchment around each doughnut, leaving a <br>
                1-inch border. Carefully invert 2 doughnuts into the shortening and peel off the parchment with tongs. Fry until golden brown, 1 minute<br>
                 30 seconds per side. (Fry the doughnut holes 30 seconds per side.) Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Bring the <br>
                 shortening back to 340 degrees F and repeat with the remaining doughnuts.</li>
